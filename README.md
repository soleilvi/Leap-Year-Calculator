# Leap-Year-Calculator
My first program in C++. It asks the user to input a year and tells them whether or not it is a leap year. 

## How to run
1) After downloading the project, go into the directory you chose for it
2) Open a command prompt window in this directory
3) Type "g++ -o lyc LeapYearGit.cpp" into the command prompt (no quotes)
4) Type "./lyc" into the command prompt (no quotes)
5) Type in the year you want to test

To re-run, type "./lyc" into the command prompt again.
